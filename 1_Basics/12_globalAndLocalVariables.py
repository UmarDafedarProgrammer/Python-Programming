"""
Scope of a Variable
In Python, the scope of a variable defines where it can be accessed in the program. There are two main types of scope: local and global.

Local Variables:
Defined within a function or block, accessible only inside that scope.
Destroyed once the function/block ends.
Temporary, used for short-term data.
Global Variables:
Defined outside functions, accessible throughout the program.
To modify within a function, use the global keyword.
Persist in memory for the programâ€™s duration, useful for shared data.

Python Variables - Python
What is the scope of a variable in Python?
The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed. Local variables are scoped to the function in which they are defined,
    while global variables can be accessed throughout the program.

Can we change the type of a variable after assigning it?
Yes, Python allows dynamic typing. A variable can hold a value of one type initially and be reassigned a value of a different type later.

What happens if we use an undefined variable?
Using an undefined variable raises a NameError. Always initialize variables before use.
