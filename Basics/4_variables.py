# Rules for Naming Variables
# To use variables effectively, we must follow Pythonâ€™s naming rules:

# Variable names can only contain letters, digits and underscores (_).
# A variable name cannot start with a digit.
# Variable names are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different).
# Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., if, else, for) as variable names.

# Dynamic Typing
# Python variables are dynamically typed, meaning the same variable can hold different types of values during execution.

var1 = 10
var2 = "value"
var3 = 4.5

print(var1, var2, var3)

var3 = 99

print(var3)

# for = 99
# invalid syntax error: as for is keyword and can not be used as a variable name
